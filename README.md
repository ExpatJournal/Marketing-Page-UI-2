# Marketing-Page-UI-2

This website is the landing page that links to a react app for a social media website that is designed specifically for expats. The front page describes the app, and has several links to the app. It also contatains some example posts so users can see what a typical post on the site looks like. 

The "Meet the Team" button in the navigation bar will bring the users to a page showing the developer team that created the product, and a small block of information about each developer.

The linked react app allows users to sign-in, sign-up, or explore the website for posts made by other expats. The purpose of this app is to give expats a social media platform that is tailored specifically to them. This way expats can see what other expats are doing, and the content will generally be presented in a more professional manner than most other popular social media platforms.
